1.4 - PureMVC 2.0.4, 
	  Added Standard PureMVC demo look and feel.
	  Updated code according to best practices.
	  Moved Mediator constructor activities to onRegister.
	  Made Mediators know less about their view components.
	  Exposed methods on view components to encapsulate functionality where 
	  mediators were too intrusive.
	  Made Mediator constructors expect the specific of component they mediate (instead of Object)
	  Made StartupCommand a MacroCommand
	  Added PrepModelCommand and PrepViewCommand. 
	  Moved population of dummy data from Proxy constructors into PrepModelCommand
	  Removed unneeded 'implements' from classes where the interface is inherited.
	  Changed casts of retrieved actors from 'myObject as MyObject' to 'MyObject( myObject )' style,
	  which is better for debugging since it causes a runtime error at the cast rather than returning 
	  null and later causing problems. Note that it was left as 'myObject as MyObject' in the getters
	  for the view components of mediators and data objects of Proxies, which are ok to be null until
	  populated.
